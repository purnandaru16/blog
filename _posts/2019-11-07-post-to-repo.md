1. Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Change the current working directory to your local project.
4. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
<code>$ git init</code>
